# CSS 'width: auto' Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS bug related to the `width: auto;` property within flexbox and grid layouts.  The issue occurs when an element's width is set to `auto`, and the element unexpectedly collapses to zero width, even when there is sufficient space in the parent container.

**Problem:** The `width: auto` declaration, while intending to let the element's width be determined by its content, can fail to adapt properly within flex or grid contexts.

**Solution:** Employ more explicit width control (e.g., `width: fit-content;`, `min-width`, `max-width`, or percentage-based widths) instead of relying solely on `width: auto;` when working with flexbox or grid.
